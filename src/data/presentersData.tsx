    bio: `
        Susan Juby’s most recent novel, *Mindful of Murder*, is a bestselling cozy mystery. It was shortlisted for the 2023 Leacock Medal for Humour. She has, in fact, been short- and long-listed for Canada’s national humour writing prize more times than any other woman in Canadian history. Fortunately, she has also won it once, for *Republic of Dirt*, saving her from becoming the Susan Lucci of the Leacock. Her first book, *Alice, I Think*, was a national bestseller adapted into a TV series on CTV, and her bestselling book, *The Woefield Poultry Collective*, remains an international fan favorite.
  
        Susan lives on Vancouver Island, where she teaches creative writing at Vancouver Island University. For hobbies, she does a lot of walking and fretting. Susan is an unskilled but earnest practitioner of Buddhism and a notably unsuccessful amateur dog trainer.
  
        “Susan Juby is one of our country’s great court jesters with her hilariously astute depictions of small-town life that always favour loving mockery over flippant derision… The best humour writers never settle for the expected – Juby is among them.” —The Globe and Mail
